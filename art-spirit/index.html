<h2>Art+Spirit Series</h2>
<h3>Mercy and Justice – Micah 6:8 in visual language for creative minds</h3>
<p><strong>Monday, February 18 at 6:30 pm</strong><br/>
<strong>Special Speaker: Sedrick Huckaby, Painter and Fine Art Professor</strong></p>
<p>With a MFA from Yale University, Huckaby is fast becoming one of America’s premier painters to watch (and collect). The Fort Worth native has been the recipient of numerous fellowships. He has been involved in community outreach since a young child that has developed a life’s awareness of the importance of diversity within the arts and in one’s spiritual life. Huckaby states that “It is indeed a strange thing to speak from ones heart without knowing the exact words to verbalize the experience. This phenomenon happens within the language of painting. A painting is a quiet dialogue in which volumes of information is slowly and silently revealed, yet its entire essence can be experienced within a moments glance. I believe my paintings are done in a language more closely in tune with my soul than the language of my tongue. For me, the act of painting is not just a means to a product; it is also a meditative process of communication. This it is with the visual language that I choose to speak about the most pressing issues of life. The resulting paintings speak about the outer world around me and the inner world within. Multifaceted works with layers of meanings are a consequence of working between the dichotomy of internal and external inspirations. If my paintings are successful they will not only speak to the viewer's intellect, but they will speak to the deeper being that lies beyond words as well. It is said that every man prays in his own language and that God understands all languages. At the end of life my greatest hope is that God is pleased with all of the prayers I left behind in the form of paintings.”</p>
